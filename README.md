### MultiMAP

This is a circuit board that would most typically be used for automotive engines running ITB setups. This board will combine multiple MAP signals, and report the lowest MAP signal to the engine control computer. This project includes designs for 2,4,6,8 and 12 MAP signals. 

This project includes, Gerber MFG files that can be uploaded to almost any MFG house, such that PCB's can be obtained. It includes BOM's and simulation files, as well as the KICAD PCB layout files. 

I have also uploaded files to BatchPCB, such that if someone want's the board, they can simply go there and purchase it.
